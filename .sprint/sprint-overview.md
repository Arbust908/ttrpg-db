## Sprint Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Sprint 0** → Must complete before ANY other work
2. **Sprint 1** → Foundation for all UI work

5. **Sprint 4** → SEO critical for discoverability

### Parallel Work Possible
- Sprint 5 & 6 can overlap with Sprint 4
- Admin tools can be developed alongside public features
- Design work can proceed ahead of implementation
