# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing Sprint 0 - Security Lockdown to disable all public game modifications before proceeding with feature development.

## Recent Changes
1. **Sprint Planning Completed** (Current Session - Jan 14, 2025)
   - Created comprehensive `.sprint/` directory with 7 sprint plans
   - Incorporated AI review feedback from ChatGPT and Claude
   - Prioritized security and content control
   - Created feature implementation roadmap
   - Added sprint backlog for future features

2. **Feature Plan Created** (Current Session - Jan 14, 2025)
   - Documented comprehensive feature plan in memory bank
   - Integrated AI review insights
   - Established phased approach with security first
   - Defined success metrics and risk mitigation

3. **Project State**
   - Basic CRUD operations for games implemented
   - Dashboard with statistics functional
   - Search and pagination working
   - UI using Nuxt UI Pro components
   - Database schema established in Supabase
   - **CRITICAL**: Public write access still enabled - Sprint 0 needed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete memory bank documentation:
   - ✅ projectbrief.md
   - ✅ productContext.md
   - ✅ systemPatterns.md
   - ✅ techContext.md
   - ⏳ activeContext.md (current)
   - ⏳ progress.md
   - ⏳ dataModel.md
   - ⏳ apiEndpoints.md
   - ⏳ uiComponents.md

2. Fix existing TypeScript issues:
   - `$fetch` not recognized in useGames.ts
   - Module resolution for `#shared/database`
   - Type assertions in pages

### Short-term Priorities
1. **Complete Core Features**
   - Implement game creation form
   - Add edit functionality for games
   - Implement relationship management (mechanics, systems, families)
   - Add advanced filtering on search page

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Fix table display in games list
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Improve error handling displays
   - Add success notifications

3. **Data Management**
   - Implement bulk operations
   - Add import/export functionality
   - Create backup/restore features

### Long-term Goals
1. **Authentication & Multi-tenancy**
   - User registration/login
   - Personal collections
   - Sharing capabilities

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time updates
   - Collaborative features
   - Mobile app development
   - API for third-party integrations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **State Management**: Using composables pattern instead of Pinia/Vuex
   - Pros: Simpler, built-in to Vue 3, type-safe
   - Cons: May need refactoring for complex state

2. **Database Access**: Direct Supabase queries vs ORM
   - Current: Direct Supabase client
   - Consideration: Might need abstraction layer for complex queries

3. **Error Handling**: Consistent pattern across app
   - Pattern: `{ data, error }` return structure
   - Need: Global error handler implementation

### Design Decisions
1. **UI Components**: Leveraging Nuxt UI Pro
   - Benefits: Consistent design, accessibility
   - Limitation: Customization constraints

2. **Navigation Structure**: Simple top-level navigation
   - Current: Dashboard, Games, Search
   - Future: Mechanics, Systems, Families pages

### Performance Considerations
1. **Search Implementation**: Currently using ILIKE queries
   - Works for small datasets
   - May need full-text search for scale

2. **Image Handling**: Direct URLs to external sources
   - Current: No image optimization
   - Future: CDN integration needed

## Current Blockers

### Technical Issues
1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - `$fetch` auto-import not working properly
   - Module path resolution issues
   - Need to investigate Nuxt 3 TypeScript setup

2. **Table Component**
   - UTable not rendering data correctly
   - May need to check Nuxt UI Pro documentation
   - Consider custom table implementation

### Knowledge Gaps
1. **Supabase Best Practices**
   - Optimal query patterns
   - RLS implementation
   - Real-time subscriptions

2. **Nuxt 3 Advanced Features**
   - Server-side caching
   - Middleware implementation
   - Plugin system

## Development Environment
- **OS**: macOS
- **Node**: 18+
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **IDE**: VSCode
- **Git**: GitHub repository
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Communication Patterns
- Clear technical documentation
- Structured problem-solving approach
- Iterative development with frequent testing
- User-focused feature development

## Notes for Next Session
When returning to this project:
1. Read all memory bank files first
2. Check for any new TypeScript errors
3. Test current functionality
4. Review Supabase dashboard for data
5. Continue with next priority items

Remember: The memory bank is the source of truth for project context. Always update it when making significant changes or discoveries.
