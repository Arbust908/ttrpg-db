# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
TTRPG collectors and enthusiasts lack a comprehensive, structured way to catalog and explore their game collections. Existing solutions are either too generic (spreadsheets) or don't capture the rich metadata and relationships specific to tabletop RPGs.

### Solution
A dedicated TTRPG database system that understands the unique aspects of role-playing games:
- Complex categorization (mechanics, systems, families)
- Historical context (honors, awards)
- Multiple naming conventions
- Community ratings and rankings

## User Problems Solved

### 1. Collection Organization
**Problem**: Games scattered across shelves with no systematic organization
**Solution**: Digital catalog with comprehensive metadata and categorization

### 2. Discovery & Search
**Problem**: Difficulty finding games by specific mechanics or systems
**Solution**: Advanced search and filtering by any attribute or relationship

### 3. Information Tracking
**Problem**: Lost or forgotten details about games in collection
**Solution**: Persistent storage of all game information including descriptions, ratings, and external links

### 4. Collection Analytics
**Problem**: No overview of collection composition and value
**Solution**: Dashboard with statistics, trends, and insights
